        <p>
            The term computer language is sometimes used interchangeably with programming language.However, the usage of
            both terms varies among authors, including the exact scope of each. One usage describes programming
            languages as a subset of computer languages.Similarly, languages used in computing that have a different
            goal than expressing computer programs are generically designated computer languages. For instance, markup
            languages are sometimes referred to as computer languages to emphasize that they are not meant to be used
            for programming.One way of classifying computer languages is by the computations they are capable of
            expressing, as described by the theory of computation. The majority of practical programming languages are
            Turing complete,and all Turing complete languages can implement the same set of algorithms. ANSI/ISO SQL-92
            and Charity are examples of languages that are not Turing complete, yet are often called programming
            languages.However, some authors restrict the term "programming language" to Turing complete languages.

        <p>
            In the contexts of software architecture, service-orientation and service-oriented architecture, the term
            service refers to a software functionality, or a set of software functionalities (such as the retrieval of
            specified information or the execution of a set of operations) with a purpose that different clients can
            reuse for different purposes, together with the policies that should control its usage (based on the
            identity of the client requesting the service, for example).
            OASIS defines a service as "a mechanism to enable access to one or more capabilities, where the access is
            provided using a prescribed interface and is exercised consistent with constraints and policies as specified
            by the service description"

        <li>One reviewer on Coursera says the course is worth the time investment and that the course material is
            informative and well organized.</li>
        <li>Another reviewer says the course balances theory and practice well, and teaches how to design elegant
            programs and use the strongest sides of a language.</li>
        <li>One review on Kinsta says that C++ is the most powerful programming language, but you shouldn't overlook
            Rust, Python, Scala, or C#.</li>
